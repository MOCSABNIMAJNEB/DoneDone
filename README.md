Emoji reminder app (done done)
you can put emojis and write whatever words nice to them that you want the idea is that you make tasks
if you click the emoji during the day then it turns a color and plays like a little sound in a haptic so you don’t press it accidentally if you want to unpress it you can long press
there is a widget that has all of the emojis or the main ones for your day that are not colored so they are black and white but if you press them they become color and they are finished
also you can set up the reminders however you want on your phone or watch and it just shows emoji or you could also make it show a text but default is emoji only
also make watch app
also it should be able to read from health and maybe you have a Google authorization to export to Google sheet which would be really nice so you can see history but we could also make native history an app but I always make export easy to like XML I guess or you could do direct to Google sheet which is kind of nice and that way we can collect data or you can login with google account but that’s optional you don’t need to do it

Done done v2

Combine done done with idea to have a food logging and exercise tracking app which exports to both Google sheets notion and potentially others

Ben’s point is to own the libraries of exporting this data so that you can sell access to other companies and make $        # DoneDone
